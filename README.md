# RISC-V from Scratch Testbed

This project is ancillary to the primary RISC-V from Scratch (CPU) project and is concerned with the design and
implementation of the debugging, programming, and testing infrastructure for the processor.

## Requirements

*TBD*

## Experiments

The `experiments` subdirectory contains some hardware and firmware designs explore potential features of the testbed
prior to incorporating them into the testbed architecture.  They are presented as-is and will not be updated after the
experiment is concluded.
